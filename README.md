#Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

##README

###Background
This GitHub repository contains a README.md, Codebook.md, and R script for my Getting and Cleaning Data Course Assignment.  This project assignment is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis using data from a wearable computing study called "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset."  

More information on this study can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The original datasets used for analysis can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

####Instructions:
1. Download the dataset from the above URL and unzip the contents into your working directory. This should be a folder called UCI HAR Dataset.
2. Save the R script in this repository "run_analysis.R" to the same working directory in step 1.
2. Open RStudio and set the working directory to the same working directory in step 1.
3. Enter the following command to the R-Studio Console:  source("run_analysis.R")
4. Then enter the following command to the R-Studio Console: run_analysis()
5. The script will produce a tidy dataset "meanData.txt" in your working directory.  Please see the codebook for more information this dataset and its contents.
